        <h2> "We have to end this torture. This place is a slaughterhouse. Rikers jail does not deserve to be operating today. Those human beings are dying [...] They don't even treat animals the way they treat these people! Even though you are sentenced to
confinement, you deserve to be alive and we have to return these people to their homes." - Melania Brown, Ralley against Riker's Island, September 2021 </h2>

      <p> After 10 deaths in the past nine months in prison on Rikers Island,
         several organizations that advocate for prison reform on Wednesday called
         for an end to the systemic abuse perpetuated by New York City public officials
         and demanded an appropriate investment to help underserved communities thrive.

         During a ralley in front of the New York City Hall, the director of the Freedom Agenda organization, Brandon Holmes,
         demanded that Mayor Bill de Blasio release the 6,082 confined to Rikers and activate Law 6-8, which would allow
         the use of alternate confinement spaces so that detainees could continue their court hearings and remain in contact with their community.

         “It has been invested in these options before, like when the city faced the COVID-19 crisis at its peak. We are still in crisis now, but this administration
         does not want to recognize it because in this case, it is poor and Black people who are dying," said Holmes during his speech.

         Indeed, the majority of people who go in and rarely come out of Riker's Island are Black people.
